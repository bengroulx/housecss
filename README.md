# housecss

```

## Using the Framework
Welcome to housecss! This functional CSS framework should be used as a
foundation for you and your team to get set up and working on a project as
quickly as possible. Whether you are expanding housecss locally, or
contributing back upstream to the housecss repo, we encourage you write CSS
according our code guidelines and conventions:

1. Write CSS as if someone is using it to learn how code. It
   needs to be sensible and learnable for new front-end developers and
   designers — everyone should be able to get going with housecss speedily.
   We achieve this by writing well-documented code.
2. Housecss is content-agnostic, meaning HTML and CSS are completely separate
   from one another. If you hide all styles from your template, the HTML
   should be well-structured and semantically correct, formatted and arranged
   in a logical hierarchy. That also means classes should be self-documenting
   and independent of elements. The exception is components, which are
   directly coupled to markup or other styles.
4. Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/househouse/housecss/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) at all times.

Note: When contributing back upstream, postcss everything with:
`npm run build && npm run minify`. Additionally, be sure to check it
with [CSS Stats](http://cssstats.com/stats?link=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fhousehouse%2Fhousecss%2Fmaster%2Fcss%2Fmain.css)
to make sure the stylesheet is still maintainable.
