# housecss
A Functional CSS Library Built for Rapid Iteration. Created and maintained by
the [House House](http://house-house.design/) folks ‚Äî [@bengroulx](https://github.com/bengroulx) and [@durfee](https://github.com/durfee/).

## Using the Framework
Welcome to housecss! This functional CSS framework should be used as a
foundation for you and your team to get set up and working on a project as
quickly as possible. Whether you are expanding housecss locally, or
contributing back upstream to the housecss repo, we encourage you write CSS
according our code guidelines and conventions:

1. Write SCSS (and CSS) as if someone is using it to learn how code. It
   needs to be sensible and learnable for new front-end developers and
   designers ‚Äî everyone should be able to get going with housecss speedily.
   We achieve this by writing well-documented code.
2. Housecss is content-agnostic, meaning HTML and CSS are completely separate
   from one another. If you hide all styles from your template, the HTML
   should be well-structured and semantically correct, formatted and arranged
   in a logical hierarchy. That also means classes should be self-documenting
   and independent of elements. The exception is components, which are
   directly coupled to markup or other styles.
3. Follow the Code of Conduct at all times.

Note: When contributing back upstream, compile your SCSS to css with:
`sass --watch scss:css --style compact`
